# Fumble
Code Golfing LLM language called `fumble`.


---

The simplist thing would be the `Hello World` program by stating exactly what you want to do.

<div class="fumble-v0" code="print the string 'Hello World'">
<pre><code>
print the string 'Hello World'
</code></pre>
</div>

---
But, what if you could not write as much?

<div class="fumble-v0">
<pre><code>
P~Hlo Wrld
</code></pre>
</div>

---

The language figures out through its instructions the meaning of what you could be fumbling through.

<div class="fumble-v0" code="x8l$pP">
<pre><code>
x8l$pP
</code></pre>
</div>
